                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Individuals who are at highest risk for developing cold-related illnesses include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Elderly</li>
                        <li>Children</li>
                        <li>Outdoor Workers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The elderly are susceptible because they have a thinner layer of fat under their skin, which doesn't help with retaining heat.
                        Additionally, blood circulation slows down as well, allowing the external parts of the body to get cold quickly.
                    </p>                    

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Children also have difficulty dealing with cold because they are less able to regulate their body temperature than adults. Infants are especially
                        at risk because of their large body surface area, small amount of subcutaneous fat, and decreased ability to shiver. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Outdoor workers also might encounter trouble with the cold due to their working conditions. Working in poor conditions such as cold weather, rain, or snow,
                        outdoor workers can quickly find themselves being inflicted by illnesses if not properly prepared for the weather.
