                        Hypothermia
                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Abnormally low body temperature affects the brain, so that the victim may be unable to think clearly. The warning signs of hypothermia include shivering, exhaustion, confusion, drowsiness, memory loss, and slurred speech. In infants, hypothermia can cause bright red, cold skin or a lack of energy. If you notice someone showing signs of hypothermia, check their temperature. If it is below 95°, the situation is an emergency - get medical attention immediately. If medical care is not available, move the victim to a warm room or shelter. Remove any wet clothing from the victim. Slowly warm the victim starting from the center of the body. Warm beverages or broth can help warm the victim. Do not give the victim alcohol, drugs, coffee, hot beverage or food. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In severe cases of hypothermia, the victim may become unconscious and may not be breathing or have a pulse. In this case, handle the victim gently and get emergency assistance. Administer CPR, even if the victim appears dead, and continue with cpr while warming up the victim, until the victim responds or medical aid arrives.
                    </p>

                        Frostbite
                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Frostbite is indicated by white or pale skin, skin that feels unusually firm or waxy, and numbness. Oftentimes the victim of frostbite won’t notice that they have it because of the numbness. Seek medical care if you find symptoms of frostbite. Check the victim also for hypothermia, as the causes are the same, but hypothermia is more life-threatening. If immediate medical care is not possible, move the victim into a warm room. Immerse the affected area into warm, but not hot water, or with body heat. Do not rub or place any pressure on the affected area, which may cause further damage. Don’t use a heating pad, heat lamp, radiator, or heat from direct flames to warm the area, as it is numb and can be easily burned.
