                        Cold related illnesses are very deadly, as prolonged exposure to cold could lead to hypothermia or even frostbite.

                        Hypothermia
                    </h3>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Hypothermia occurs once your body's temperature has crossed a certain threshold. Low body temperature affects the victim's brain, 
                        preventing them from thinking clearly. Hypothermia is especially dangerous because the victim could be unaware that they have been afflicted.
                        Some symptoms include shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, and drowsiness.
                    </p>

                        Frostbite
                    </h3>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Frostbite is damage to your body tissue from the extreme cold. There will be a loss of feeling and color in affected areas. The most susceptible body parts are the ones
                        furthest away from your center, including the nose, fingers, toes, ears, and chin. Frostbite can lead to permanent damage to your body, which could also
                        include amputation. Symptoms of frostbite include redness/pain on any skin area, white or grayish-yellow colored-skin, numbness, or unusually firm skin.
