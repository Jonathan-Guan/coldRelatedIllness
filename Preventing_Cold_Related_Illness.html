                        It is important to take countermeasures against extreme colds, in order to decrease the risk of cold-related illnesses. 
                        Checking weather forecasts regularly can help warn you of periods of extreme cold. Insulate the water supply so it is less likely to freeze. 
                        Weather-proof your home as much as possible, using insulation, weather stripping, insulated doors and storm/thermal-pane windows. 
                        Older people are more susceptible to cold due to a lesser ability to feel temperature change. 
                        Those 65 and older should place a thermometer in their home, somewhere they can check easily and often.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        When travelling in extreme cold weather, notify somebody before you go. 
                        Bring additional warm clothing. Donâ€™t rely on a car to provide sufficient heat, have a plan to stay warm in the case of an emergency. 
                        Carry a fully charged mobile phone to contact someone in the case that you get stranded.
                    </p>

                        Hypothermia occurs once your body's temperature has crossed a certain threshold. Low body temperature affects the victim's brain, 
                        preventing them from thinking clearly. Hypothermia is especially dangerous because the victim might not be aware they have been already afflicted by hypothermia.
                        Some symptoms include shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, and drowsiness.
